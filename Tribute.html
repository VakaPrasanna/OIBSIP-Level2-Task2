                About the St. Teresa of Calcutta  
            </h1>  
<p>  
                ☛Mother Teresa was born in Skopje in 1910 to an Albanian family as Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu. She became wedded to religious vows at an early age and moved to India to join the missionary work of the Catholic Church. Heart shaken by the misery faced by the Indian masses, in 1950 she set up her own charity, the Missionaries of Charity, and began giving medical treatment to the dying poor of Calcutta. “I think”, she said, “it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ. I think the world is being much helped by the suffering of the poor people”.
